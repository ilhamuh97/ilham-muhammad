Key achievements of the application include its ease of use and accessibility for users of all skill levels. The application has a responsive design, which enables it to be accessed via mobile phones as well.\n
The process of creating a model for image classification using the ClassifyAI web-based application involves four key steps:\n
1. Class Creation and Data Collection
2. Setting Parameters for Training and Data Augmentation
3. Training and Evaluation
4. Prediction using the Trained Model\n
The application utilizes several javascript-based libraries, including React for the frontend, TensorFlow.js for the machine learning, p5.js for image processing, ApexCharts.js for data visualization, and AntDesign for the UI.`,
